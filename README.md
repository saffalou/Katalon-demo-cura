This is the result of some Playwright practice using the website https://katalon-demo-cura.herokuapp.com/

The tests are set up to utilise POM to make the actual test scripts cleaner and easier to amend, organise.

The tests are not perfect or complete but they are the result of me learning things.

It also means there might be assertions in the tests that I wouldn't neccessarily use. In a learning context I'm less fussed about the need for the assertion than learning how to use it so that it works properly.
